# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This learning resource is designed to guide students and developers through the fundamentals of building intelligent robotic systems, from middleware architecture to physical robot modeling.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers three critical domains of humanoid robotics development:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Master the Robot Operating System 2, the industry-standard middleware for robotic applications
2. **Python Agents & Controllers** - Build intelligent control systems that bridge high-level decision-making with low-level hardware
3. **URDF Modeling** - Model humanoid robots using the Unified Robot Description Format for simulation and real-world deployment

## Course Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Module 1 introduces ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of robotic applications. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robot through a publish-subscribe architecture.

**Chapters:**

- **[Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./module-1/chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Nodes, topics, services, and the ROS 2 graph
- **[Chapter 2: Python Agents & Controllers](./module-1/chapter-2-python-agents-controllers.md)** - Building intelligent control loops with rclpy
- **[Chapter 3: Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF](./module-1/chapter-3-humanoid-modeling-urdf.md)** - Kinematic chains, joints, and visual models

## Prerequisites

Before starting this textbook, you should have:

- **Python 3.10+** - Basic programming knowledge in Python
- **Linux Environment** - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended (or Windows with WSL2)
- **ROS 2 Humble** - Follow our [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md) to install ROS 2

## How to Use This Textbook

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Conceptual Overview** - Theory and architecture explained in plain language
2. **Practical Examples** - Runnable Python code with line-by-line comments
3. **Hands-On Exercises** - Build working examples in your own ROS 2 workspace
4. **Visual Aids** - Diagrams illustrating system architecture and data flow
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common errors and how to resolve them

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Start with our [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md) to install ROS 2 Humble, then dive into [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./module-1/chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md).

All code examples are available in the `ros2-examples/` directory of this repository.

## About This Project

This textbook is part of the **Governor Sindh IT Initiative** hackathon project on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It follows a spec-driven development approach, ensuring all content is accurate, reproducible, and aligned with industry best practices.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Docusaurus 3.x** - Static site generation with React
- **ROS 2 Humble** - Long-term support release of Robot Operating System 2
- **Python 3.10+** - Primary programming language for ROS 2 examples
- **Mermaid.js** - Diagram rendering for architecture visualizations
